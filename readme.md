Proof of Concept Using Star Wars Data
============

This is a proof of concept project that [OverStory](http://overstory.co.uk) did as an
exercise to mash up data from several sources into a common graph data model.  We used
several publicly available sources of data about the Star Wars universe.  The data was
stored in [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com), the web application was done with [Angular 2](https://angular.io)
and some lightweight [RatPack](https://ratpack.io) middleware ties it together.

A live demo of the resulting Star Wars Graph is available online at
[starwars.overstory.co.uk](http://starwars.overstory.co.uk).  See further details
there on the landing page and have a play with the live, clickable dynamic graph.

The source is available here.  It's a bit rough and not well documented, but it served
its purpose to help us try a few things out.
